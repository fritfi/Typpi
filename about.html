            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Typpi is a modern typing practice platform designed to help students, professionals, and lifelong
                learners improve their typing skills while enhancing information retention. We believe that actively
                retyping notes and study materials is one of the most effective ways to learn and remember information.
            </p>

            <h2>What is Typpi?</h2>
            <p>Typpi transforms the passive act of reading notes into an active learning experience. By requiring users
                to type out their study materials, we engage multiple cognitive processes that strengthen memory
                formation and improve recall. Our platform combines proven learning techniques with modern web
                technology to create an effective, enjoyable practice environment.</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>

            <h3>Practice Mode</h3>
            <p>Our core feature allows you to paste any text—lecture notes, textbook excerpts, vocabulary lists, or code
                snippets—and practice typing it out. The interface provides real-time feedback, tracks your progress,
                and displays your typing speed (WPM) and accuracy.</p>

            <h3>Race Mode</h3>
            <p>Challenge yourself with our competitive race mode, where you can test your typing speed against the
                clock. Perfect for building muscle memory and improving your typing efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Cloud Synchronization</h3>
            <p>Sign in with your Google account to sync your practice sessions and progress across all your devices.
                Your notes and statistics are securely stored and accessible whenever you need them.</p>

            <h3>Customizable Options</h3>
            <p>Tailor your practice experience with options for case sensitivity and punctuation. Whether you're
                focusing on speed or accuracy, Typpi adapts to your learning goals.</p>

            <h2>The Science Behind Active Typing</h2>
            <p>Research in cognitive psychology has consistently shown that active recall and repetition are among the
                most effective learning strategies. When you retype your notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> The act of typing engages motor memory and reinforces neural pathways
                </li>
                <li><strong>Active Engagement:</strong> You're forced to process each word, rather than passively
                    skimming</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Multiple exposures to the material strengthen long-term retention</li>
                <li><strong>Focus:</strong> The typing interface minimizes distractions and keeps you engaged</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who is Typpi For?</h2>

            <h3>Students</h3>
            <p>Whether you're in high school, college, or graduate school, Typpi helps you retain lecture notes, study
                for exams, and master complex material through active practice.</p>

            <h3>Professionals</h3>
            <p>Improve your typing speed for work, learn new industry terminology, or practice technical documentation.
                Typpi adapts to professional development needs.</p>

            <h3>Language Learners</h3>
            <p>Practice vocabulary, grammar patterns, and sentence structures in your target language. The repetitive
                typing helps build familiarity and fluency.</p>

            <h3>Programmers</h3>
            <p>Type out code snippets, algorithms, and syntax to build muscle memory for your programming language of
                choice.</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Typpi was created by Prithvee Arora, a developer and student who recognized the power of active
                note-taking. Frustrated with traditional flashcard apps and passive reading, Prithvee built Typpi to
                combine typing practice with effective learning strategies. What started as a personal tool has grown
                into a platform used by learners around the world.</p>

            <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
            <p>We take your privacy seriously. Typpi uses industry-standard encryption and security practices to protect

            <h2>Free and Accessible</h2>
            <p>Typpi is free to use and accessible to everyone. We believe that effective learning tools should be
                available to all students and learners, regardless of their financial situation. Our platform is
                supported by ethical advertising that doesn't compromise your experience.</p>
